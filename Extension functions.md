## Extension functions

Kotlin's Extension functions add member funcions to existing classes.

The type that is extended is called the receiver

To define an extension class you precede the function name with the receiver type

Example 
```
fun ReceiverType.extensionFunction() { ... }

````

Extension functions are called as if they were memebers of the class

To use extensions from another library you must import them
