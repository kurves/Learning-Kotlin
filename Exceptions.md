### Exceptions

When an exception is thrown, the current path of execution stops, and the exception object ejects from the current context. 

When an exception isn't caught, the program aborts and displays a stack trace containing detailed information.


To throw an exception, use the throw keyword followed by the exception you want to throw, along with any arguments it might need.
