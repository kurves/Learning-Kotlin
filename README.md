## Hello World !

Writing an empty functio in Kotlin that does nothing
```
func main() {
//  Program code goes here
}
```

### Comments in Kotlin 

#### Single line

Comments use double forward slash  //

The '// Program code goes here' is a comment which is ignored at run time.

#### Multi line comments

Multi line comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and forward slash */

```
/* This ia s multi line 
comment 
*/

```
A function tha prints hello world

```
func main() {

println('Hello World')
}
