Writing an empty functio in Kotlin that does nothing
```

}
```

### Comments in Kotlin 

#### Single line

Comments use double forward slash  //

The '// Program code goes here' is a comment which is ignored at run time.

#### Multi line comments

Multi line comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and forward slash */

```
/* This ia s multi line 
comment 
*/

```
A function tha prints hello world

```
func main() {

println('Hello World')
}
```

#### Specifying identifiers in Kotlin

We can specify identifiers using the following keywords : val and var

**Val** Val is immutable use this for value that do not change 

You cannot reassign the value of val

**Var** is mutable use  this for variables that change during runtime

You can reassign he value of a var

Example using var

```
fun main(){

var name = kurves'
}
```
Example using val

```
fun main(){

val age =28
age =age +2
age+=2
}
```
