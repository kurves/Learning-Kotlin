### Data Types

Type tells Kotlin how we intend to use the data

- **Double** - To hold fraction number

- **Int** - to hold whole number 

- **Boolean** - to hold the values true or false

- **Char** - Hold one character

- **String** - Sequence of characters

Kotlin can also figure out the type for for us in what is callled type inference

We can also bemore verbose and speify the type

```
var age: int = 26
```
